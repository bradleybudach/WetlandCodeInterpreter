# NWI Wetland Code Interpreter for ArcGIS Pro

This is a ArcGIS Pro add-in that is able to check if NWI wetland codes are valid. Simply type in the code to check and it will give a breakdown of exactly what it means based on official NWI data.

Install this add-in into ArcGIS Pro by downloading the .esriAddinX file found [here](WetlandCodeInterpreter/bin/Release/net6.0-windows/). Then double click the file to install. It will appear in the add-in tab of ArcGIS Pro upon restart.
